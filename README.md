# Lane_detection_python_OpenCV
Lane Line detection is a critical component for self driving cars and also for computer vision in general. This concept is used to describe the path for self-driving cars and to avoid the risk of getting in another lane.
In this article, we will build a machine learning project to detect lane lines in real-time. We will do this using the concepts of computer vision using OpenCV library. To detect the lane we have to detect the white markings on both sides on the lane.

Installation and Setup

Need to make sure we have all the software packages installed. Check to see if you have OpenCV installed on your machine. 

pip install opencv-python

Make sure you have NumPy installed, a scientific computing library for Python.

pip install numpy
